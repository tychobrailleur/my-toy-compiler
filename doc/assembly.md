As I am using `gcc -S` to figure out the code that needs to be
generated, this page describes GNU AS as I understand it — usual
warnings here: this is my own understanding of how it works, it could be
incorrect...



Syntax of an instruction:

    opcode source, destination
    
Instruction names finish with `q`, `l`, `w` or `b`, depending on the
size of the operands: `q` for quadriword, `l` for long, `w` for word
and `b` for byte.

## Registers

To use 64 bits, registers must be named with `r`, to use only the
lowest 32 bits, they must be named with `e`: `%rax` uses the whole
register, `%eax` uses only the lowest 32.

* `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx` are the general purpose registers.
  Remember, if using the lower 32 bits, they become `eax`, `ebx`,
  `ecx`, `edx`.
* `rsi`, `rdi` are the index registers.
* `rsp` is the stack pointer

## Addressing

* Immediate addressing: set constant (prefixed with `$`) directly into a register:
    movl $4, %eax
    addl $-45, %esi
* Register indirect: When using the register between parenthesis, it holds a memory _address_:
    movl $45, (%ebx) # store 45 at the memory location whose address is stored in ebx
* Register indexed: When using an offset with an index register:
    movl $45, 12(%ebx)
